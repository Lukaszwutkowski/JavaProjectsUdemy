Scenario: You are a back-end developer and need to create an application to handle new customer bank account requests.

Your application should do following:

- Read a .csv file of names, social security numbers, account type and initial deposit
- Use a proper data structure to hold all these accounts
- Both savings and checking accounts share the following properties:

    deposit()
    withdraw()
    transfer()
    showInfo()

    11 - Digit Account Number (generated with the following process: 1 or 2 depending on Savings or Checking,
    last two digits of SSN, unique 5-digit number and random 3 digit number)

- Saving Account holders are giveb a Safety Deposit Box, identified by a 3-digit number and accessed
    with a 4-digit code
- Checking Account holders are assigned a Debit Card with a 12-digit number and 4-digit PIN
- Both accounts will use an interface that determines the base interest rate.
    Savings account will use .25 points less than base rate
    Checking accounts will use 15% of base rate
- The ShowInfo method should reveal relevant account information as well as information specific to the Checking account
    Saving account.

Learning objectives:

- Learn to develop a robust application architecture
- Use when to use abstract classes and abstract methods
- Use an interface API to receive information from a developer's application
- Explore access modifiers and when to use public, private or protected
- Read data from a file and store in an appropriate data structure
- Generate random numbers and work with String API
